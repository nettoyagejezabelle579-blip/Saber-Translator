# UI Maintenance Decisions

This document describes the final maintenance policy for the UI layer. It is
not a backlog or migration ledger. Daily development should use
`npm run lint:ui`; proactive architecture review can use
`npm run lint:ui:audit`.

## Current Contract

- Component styles live with the owning Vue component in `<style scoped>`.
- `*.global.styles.css` is reserved for explicit Teleport or slot
  reach-through owners such as modal containers and global overlays.
- Ordinary `*.styles.css` script imports are not allowed because they create
  hidden global style ownership.
- Token files are the only global token source. UI source must not reference
  retired short aliases, value-named tokens, generated numbered owner tokens, or
  `--palette-*` internals. Color values belong directly to semantic,
  component, or domain tokens.
- Global tokens must terminate in at least one production source consumer.
  Token-to-token references alone do not justify retaining an otherwise dead
  token chain.
- Primitive public custom properties are consumed with explicit fallbacks.
  Primitive variants set private fallback properties and never shadow the
  public property that an owning product component may override.
- Large cohesive components are allowed when splitting would mainly add
  prop/event plumbing. Line count is a review signal, not a target or a
  forced split rule.
- Mixed state owners are extracted by responsibility rather than size. Schema
  parsing, theme lifecycle, streaming state, display animation, and model
  discovery may live in focused helpers while the store or component facade
  retains domain orchestration and its public API.
- High-risk visual states are protected by visual regression tests instead of
  comments about past implementations.

## Split Rules

- Split when a child can own a real UI region, modal body, list, form section,
  or independently tested interaction.
- Extract a composable when behavior is reusable or large enough to understand
  separately from the template.
- Keep a component whole when state, template, and pointer/keyboard interaction
  must be understood together.
- Never split CSS by horizontal names such as `base`, `layout`, `panels`, or
  `responsive`.

## Audit Output

`lint:ui:audit` reports current health signals:

- token file count,
- `:root` token count,
- token dependency count,
- critical visual state coverage count,
- heavy owner review signal count,
- owner token density signals.

It must not print large-owner candidates, pending split decisions, or
layout bypass todo lists. If a real violation appears, default `lint:ui` should
fail with the exact file and rule.

## Critical Visual States

The architecture lint checks that these visual contracts remain covered in
`tests/visual/ui-regression.spec.ts`:

| State | Visual Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Translate empty shell | `translate workspace empty state keeps its layout contract` |
| Translate loaded sidebars | `translate loaded workspace keeps fixed sidebar sizing contract` |
| EditWorkspace dark shell | `translate edit workspace keeps dark editor shell contract` |
| EditWorkspace selected bubble editor | `translate edit workspace selected bubble keeps editor panel contract` |
| Insight selected-book sidebars | `insight selected-book sidebars keep their gutter contract` |
| Reader immersive shell | `reader loaded state keeps its layout contract` |
| Character Studio empty shell | `character studio empty workspace keeps its layout contract` |
| Character Studio editor/preview shell | `character studio editor and preview keep split workspace contract` |
